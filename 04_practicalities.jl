# Chapter 4 Quotes
those quotes can be put into anki

1. Question: What's the purpose of the Delta-hedge? Answer: Eliminate risk from the portfolio by making the derivative of the portfolio with respect to the stock price zero

2. A portfolio whose price has zero derivative at a point will (zero derivative but probably non-zero second-order derivative) still change in value if the asset moves a short distance from that point.

3. Each one of these has a Delta and since the model is linear, the trader can hedge them all simply by adding their Deltas together.

4. Deltas will at least partially cancel each other.
